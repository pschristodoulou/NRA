    "A - Explore what happens when you change the binning in the definition of the firing rate maps (`space_bins`). Make it coarser or broader. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "B - In the spike train simulations, we add some \"baseline\" noise, not place-related to the firing. Which variable determines the noise level? Try to experiment with that variable and see what happens to the firing rate maps. What is the best approach to firing rate maps when the noise is high.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "C - We could use other approaches to firing rate maps: for example make the binning very small (down to 1 cm, which is the resolution of our \"video\" data, and then applying a gaussian smoother. Scipy has a Gaussian smoother at `scipy.stats.gaussian_kde`. Read the documentation for that function and apply it to the data to define the smoothed firing rate maps. Again, change the noise levels and see how the smoother changes. \n",
    "\n",
    "D - When analyzing place fields, two important quantities are the place field center and the place field width. The place field center may be defined in many ways, but one is to compute the \"center of mass\" of the spikes according to the equation \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ c_{pf} = \\frac{1}{N_{spikes}} \\sum_{i} L_i $$ \n",
    "\n",
    "where the sum on $i$ runs on all spikes emitted by a cell and $L_i$ is the location at which the i-th spike was emitted. Calculate this for each cell. Compare with the \"true\" place field centers from the simulations (which variables are we talking about?) \n"
